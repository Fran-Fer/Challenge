# Challenge

## Description
This small challenged was made using swift and UIKit, implemented in viper architecture. 

The app consumes an api which brings forth an array of recipes, which are then displayed in a table view, alongside a banner at the bottom which displays a random dish.

Uppon tapping on any cell, the app pushes into a detail view, which shows an image of the dish, as well as it's description, and a list of ingridients.

Baic testing was implemented to ensure the main presenter (the heart of the app) is making the correct calls at the correct time, however, the protocol oriented structure should make implementing more meaningful tests easier down the line.
